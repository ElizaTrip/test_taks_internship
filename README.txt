NOTES ABOUT THE PROGRAM.
I decided to write this program in a single file without adding parts of it to function.
Although it is recommended to hide secret keys, I left it to show my ability to work with Google API.
Since there were no instructions on cases of team names, I decided that name "Brandtech Lab" was a result of a typo and not an intentional thing.
In your output average reasons of team Tech Lab are equal 9.33, but all calculaters show that it supposed to be 10, so that is not mistake on my part.
